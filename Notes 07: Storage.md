# 7.01 What is a Network?
* The internet is tens of thousands kilometres of fiber optic cable, hundreds of thousands to millions of kilometres of copper wire, and hardware and software connecting them all together in a redundant, fast, and self-sufficient network.
* At its core, a **computer network** is just two or more client machines that are connected together, using a network device, to share resources.
* A network can be logically partitioned to create subnets.
* A router or switch are used to connect the clients together and enable communications.

# 7.02 Definitions for Computer Networking
## Computer Network
* It is the interconnection of multiple devices, generally termed as Hosts connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media.
* There are also multiple devices or mediums which helps in the communication between two different devices which are known as **Network devices**.
* The layout pattern using which devices are interconnected is called as **network topology**.

## OSI
**OSI** stands for Open Systems Interconnection and is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer.
It includes:
  * **Layer 7 - Application** - The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application.
  * **Layer 6 - Presentation** - The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them.
  * **Layer 5 - Session**
The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application.
  * **Layer 4 - Transport**
The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.
  * **Layer 3 - Network**
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from one node to another connected in "different networks".
  * **Layer 2 - Data Link**
The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes
  * **Layer 1 - Physical**
Responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical transmission medium.
