#1.1: What is Information Technology (IT)?
Cloud computing is a subset of information technology that utilizes all of the same terminology as it relates to governance, operations, software, hardware, and infrastructure as traditional information technology.

##In this class you will explore:
* Compute
* Storage
* Networking
* Security, identity, and compliance
* Billing and cost management
* Management and governance
* And more

#1.2 Why Is Information Technology Important?
* The work of most businesses, schools, or organizations would slow to a crawl or stop without functioning Information Technology (IT) systems.
* “IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a Chief Information Security Officer and technology blogger.

##Let’s take a look at the needs that current and future IT specialists will be working on:
* Data Overload: Businesses need to process huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of processing power, sophisticated software and human analytical skills.
* Mobile and Wireless Usages: More employers are offering remote work options that require smartphones, tablets and laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming ability.
* Cloud Services: Many businesses no longer operate their own “server farms” to store massive amounts of data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain that data.
* Bandwidth for Video: Videoconferencing solutions have become more and more popular, so more network bandwidth is needed to support them sufficiently.

#1.3 Hardware vs Software
* Hardware includes all the physical aspects of an information technology system.
* Software encompasses all the data, application code and programs stored digitally, like an operating system or a document editor.

##So how does this distinction apply to a cloud environment?
* Virtual cloud hardware still uses CPU’s, RAM and Hard Drives, but actually run as software on top of specialized hardware that is shared amongst a variety of other virtual environments. You configure these virtual environments them via specialized software in a web-based cloud control panel.
* Software can also run in a cloud environment just as they would in a physical hardware environment. The difference is that you have your software running on virtual hardware instead of physical hardware.
