#1.1: What is Information Technology (IT)?
Cloud computing is a subset of information technology that utilizes all of the same terminology as it relates to governance, operations, software, hardware, and infrastructure as traditional information technology.

##In this class you will explore:
* Compute
* Storage
* Networking
* Security, identity, and compliance
* Billing and cost management
* Management and governance
* And more

#1.2 Why Is Information Technology Important?
* The work of most businesses, schools, or organizations would slow to a crawl or stop without functioning Information Technology (IT) systems.
* “IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a Chief Information Security Officer and technology blogger.

##Let’s take a look at the needs that current and future IT specialists will be working on:
* Data Overload: Businesses need to process huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of processing power, sophisticated software and human analytical skills.
* Mobile and Wireless Usages: More employers are offering remote work options that require smartphones, tablets and laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming ability.
* Cloud Services: Many businesses no longer operate their own “server farms” to store massive amounts of data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain that data.
* Bandwidth for Video: Videoconferencing solutions have become more and more popular, so more network bandwidth is needed to support them sufficiently.

#1.3 Hardware vs Software
* Hardware includes all the physical aspects of an information technology system.
* Software encompasses all the data, application code and programs stored digitally, like an operating system or a document editor.

##So how does this distinction apply to a cloud environment?
* Virtual cloud hardware still uses CPU’s, RAM and Hard Drives, but actually run as software on top of specialized hardware that is shared amongst a variety of other virtual environments. You configure these virtual environments them via specialized software in a web-based cloud control panel.
* Software can also run in a cloud environment just as they would in a physical hardware environment. The difference is that you have your software running on virtual hardware instead of physical hardware.

#1.5 Common Terminology in IT: Introduction
Common terminology in Information Technology, including:
* Job Roles & Occupations in IT
* Computer Components
  * Motherboard
  * Central Processing Unit (CPU)
  * Random Access Memory (RAM)
  * Hard Drive
* Areas of Information Technology

#1.6 Terminology: Job Roles & Occupations
Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 546,200 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security.

The median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations was $88,240 in May 2019, which was higher than the median annual wage for all occupations of $39,810.

#1.7 Terminology: Computer Components

* Motherboard
* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
* Random Access Memory (RAM)
* Storage Drives
* Expansion Cards
 * Graphic Cards (GPU)
 * Audio Cards
 * Networking Components
* Cooling
* Power Supply
* Case
* Input & Output Devices
* Peripherals
In cloud computing, it is important to understand the components specifically related to the CPU, RAM, Storage, and Expansion Cards like Graphic Cards (GPU).

#1.8 Terminology: Motherboard
* Also known as the main board, logic board, or system board
* The main component of a computer and is what connects other parts of the computer through integrated circuitry
* Biggest piece of silicon you see in your computer
* The motherboard is what makes everything in your computer work together
* Components that attach to the motherboard either directly or to part of it include:
 * Central Processing Unit (CPU)
 * Random Access Memory (RAM)
 * Expansion Cards (like a Graphics Card)
 * These components connect to the CPU via the the buses on the motherboard where a collection of chips and controllers known as the chipset mediates communications between the CPU and the components
* Motherboards have input and output ports that are availble to plug devices into the in order to intereact with the computer:
 * Monitor (HDMI, Thunderbolt, VGA, DVI, etc)
 * USB for Keyboard & Mouse
* Networking
* Audio Input / Output

##List of the different form factors or sizes of motherboards:
* Standard-ATX
* Micro-ATX
* Mini-ATX
* Nano-ATX
* Pico-ATX

#1.9 Terminology: Firmware / BIOS
* BIOS stands for "Basic Input/Output System."
* The CPU accesses the BIOS even before the operating system is loaded.
* The BIOS then checks all your hardware connections and locates all your devices.
* If everything is OK, the BIOS loads the operating system into the computer's memory and finishes the boot-up process.
* It is located in a ROM (Read-Only Memory) chip of the computer.
* This is important to understand if you are managing physical computing equipment.

#1.10 Terminology: CPU
* Your cloud service provider will provide you with a series of options for the number of CPU, speed, and type
* CPU stands for "Central Processing Unit"
* The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions
* The CPU contains a minimum of one processor, which is the actual chip inside the CPU that performs calculations
* The ARM(Advanced RISC Machines) processor is a 32-bit RISC processor, meaning it is built using the RISC (reduced instruction set computer) ISA (instruction set architecture)

#1.11 Terminology: RAM 
* Cloud service provider will provide you with a series of options for the amount of RAM
* Random Access Memory
* Made up of small memory chips that form a memory module
* As RAM improves, its speed and the amount you can put on a single stick increases
* Every time you open a program, it gets loaded from the hard drive into the RAM because reading data from the RAM is much faster than reading data from the hard drive

#1.12 Terminology: Storage
* Cloud service provider will provide you with a series of options for the type and amount of storage you need
* Storage is where you keep files for your operating system, applications and documents
* 2 types of storage devices
 * primary -  holds files for the operating system and any critical applications
 * secondary - can be removable, internal, or external and can be used to hold files or applications depending on the setup
* 2 main types of storage:
 * Hard Disk Drive (HDD) - a non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer
 * Solid State Drive (SSD) - an SSD is a storage medium that uses non-volatile memory as a means of holding and accessing data

#1.13 Terminology: Expansion Cards / GPU
* Many graphics cards can be used in place of the CPU for heavy processing loads
* GPU is an electronic circuit used to speed up the creation of both 2D and 3D images
* GPUs can either be integrated, meaning they are built into the computer's CPU or motherboard, or they can be dedicated, meaning they are a separate piece of hardware known as a video card
* GPUs are used as a part of High-Performance Computing in order to accelerate machine-learning or increase speed for advanced modeling of scientific calculations when used in cloud
* Expansion cards include but are not limited to:
 * Audio Cards
 * Graphics Cards
 * Network Cards
 * TV Tuners
 * USB Cards
 * Video Capture

#1.14 Terminology: Misc
* Case - provides support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components
* Cooling:
 * Fan - hardware device that keeps the overall computer or a computer device cool by circulating air to or from the computer or component
 * Hot sink
  * Active - utilize the computer's power supply, may include a fan, and sometimes referred to as an HSF, which is short for heat sink and fan
  * Passive - have no mechanical components. Consequently, they are 100% reliable. Passive heat sinks are made of an aluminum finned radiator that dissipates heat through convection. For passive heat sinks to work to their full capacity, there should be a steady airflow moving across the fins.
* Liquid Cooling - water cooling or liquid cooling is a system used to reduce the temperature of its hardware, specifically the CPU and GPU. Liquid is more efficient than gas at conducting thermal energy, so liquid cooled machines maintain desired operating temperatures better than their air cooled counterparts.
* Power Supply - converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the internal components of the computer
* Input / Output Devices - input devices allow the user to enter data into a system, or control its operation and output devices are designed around the senses of human beings which include vision, hearing, or touch
