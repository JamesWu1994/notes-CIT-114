# 2.1 A Brief History
* The idea of cloud traces back to the origins of utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961
  * "If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry."
* The general public has been leveraging forms of Internet-based computer utilities since the mid-1990s
* Search engines (Yahoo!, Google), e-mail services (Hotmail, Gmail), open publishing platforms (MySpace, Facebook, YouTube), and other types of social media (Twitter, LinkedIn). Though consumer-centric, these services popularized and validated core concepts that form the basis of modern-day cloud computing.
* In the late 1990s, Salesforce.com pioneered the notion of bringing remotely provisioned services into the enterprise.
* In 2002, Amazon.com launched the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, a suite of enterprise-oriented services that provide remotely provisioned storage, computing resources, and business functionality.
* A slightly different evocation of the term "Network Cloud" or "Cloud" was introduced in the early 1990s throughout the networking industry.
* It wasn't until 2006 that the term "cloud computing" emerged in the commercial arena.
# 2.2 Business Drivers
* The origins and inspirations of many of the characteristics, models, and mechanisms covered throughout subsequent chapters can be traced back to the upcoming business drivers.
## Capacity Planning
* Capacity planning is the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services.
* Within this context, capacity represents the maximum amount of work that an IT resource is capable of delivering in a given period of time.
* A discrepancy between the capacity of an IT resource and its demand can result in a system becoming either inefficient (over-provisioning) or unable to fulfill user needs (under-provisioning).
* Seeks to minimize this discrepancy
* Different capacity planning strategies exist:
  * Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
  * Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
  * Match Strategy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases
* Planning for capacity can be challenging because it requires estimating usage load fluctuations.
* There is a constant need to balance peak usage requirements without unnecessary over-expenditure on infrastructure.
## Cost Reduction
* A direct alignment between IT costs and business performance can be difficult to maintain.
* This can make the support of new and expanded business automations an ever-increasing investment. 
* Much of this required investment is funneled into infrastructure expansion because the usage potential of a given automation solution will always be limited by the processing power of its underlying infrastructure.
* Two costs need to be accounted for:
  * The cost of acquiring new infrastructure
  * The cost of its ongoing ownership.
* Operational overhead represents a considerable share of IT budgets, often exceeding up-front investment costs.
* Common forms of infrastructure-related operating overhead include the following:
  * Technical personnel required to keep the environment operational
  * Upgrades and patches that introduce additional testing and deployment cycles
  * Utility bills and capital expense investments for power and cooling
  * Security and access control measures that need to be maintained and enforced to protect infrastructure resources
  * Administrative and accounts staff that may be required to keep track of licenses and support arrangements
 ## Organizational Agility
* Organizational agility is the measure of an organization's responsiveness to change.
* An IT enterprise often needs to respond to business change by scaling its IT resources beyond the scope of what was previously predicted or planned for.
# 2.3 Concepts and Terminology
## Cloud
* A cloud refers to a distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources.
* The term originated as a metaphor for the Internet which is, in essence, a network of networks providing remote access to a set of decentralized IT resources.
* A cloud was commonly used to represent the Internet in a variety of specifications and mainstream documentation of Web-based architectures. 
* Much of the Internet is dedicated to the access of content-based IT resources published via the World Wide Web.
* IT resources provided by cloud environments, on the other hand, are dedicated to supplying back-end processing capabilities and user-based access to these capabilities.
* Another key distinction is that it is not necessary for clouds to be Web-based even if they are commonly based on Internet protocols and technologies.
* A cloud can be based on the use of any protocols that allow for the remote access to its IT resources.
## IT Resource
* An IT resource is a physical or virtual IT-related artifact that can be either software based, such as a virtual server or a custom software program, or hardware-based, such as a physical server or a network device
* Examples of IT resource:
 * physical server
 * virtual server
 * software program
 * service
 * storage device
 * network device
## On-Premise
* An IT resource that is hosted in a conventional IT enterprise within an organizational boundary (that does not specifically represent a cloud) is considered to be located on the premises of the IT enterprise, or on-premise for short.
* In other words, the term "on-premise" is another way of stating "on the premises of a controlled IT environment that is not cloud-based."
* This term is used to qualify an IT resource as an alternative to "cloud-based." An IT resource that is on-premise cannot be cloud-based, and vice-versa.
* An on-premise IT resource can access and interact with a cloud-based IT resource.
* An on-premise IT resource can be moved to a cloud, thereby changing it to a cloud-based IT resource.
* Redundant deployments of an IT resource can exist in both on-premise and cloud based environments.
## Scaling
*  the ability of the IT resource to handle increased or decreased usage demands.
*  The following are types of scaling:
 * Horizontal Scaling - scaling out and scaling in
  * The allocating or releasing of IT resources that are of the same type is referred to as horizontal scaling
 * Vertical Scaling - scaling up and scaling down
  * When an existing IT resource is replaced by another with higher or lower capacity, vertical scaling is considered to have occurred
## Cloud Service
* A cloud service is any IT resource that is made remotely accessible via a cloud. Unlike other IT fields that fall under the service technology umbrella - such as service-oriented architecture - the term "service" within the context of cloud computing is especially broad.
* A cloud service can exist as a simple Web-based software program with a technical interface invoked via the use of a messaging protocol, or as a remote access point for administrative tools or larger environments and other IT resources.
## Cloud Service Consumer
* The cloud service consumer is a temporary runtime role assumed by a software program when it accesses a cloud service.
# 2.4 Goals and Benefits
## Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs
* Similar to a product wholesaler that purchases goods in bulk for lower price points, public cloud providers base their business model on the mass-acquisition of IT resources that are then made available to cloud consumers via attractively priced leasing packages.
* This opens the door for organizations to gain access to powerful infrastructure without having to purchase it themselves.
* The most common economic rationale for investing in cloud-based IT resources is in the reduction or outright elimination of up-front IT investments, namely hardware and software purchases and ownership costs.
