# 2.1 A Brief History
* The idea of cloud traces back to the origins of utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961
  * "If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry."
* The general public has been leveraging forms of Internet-based computer utilities since the mid-1990s
* Search engines (Yahoo!, Google), e-mail services (Hotmail, Gmail), open publishing platforms (MySpace, Facebook, YouTube), and other types of social media (Twitter, LinkedIn). Though consumer-centric, these services popularized and validated core concepts that form the basis of modern-day cloud computing.
* In the late 1990s, Salesforce.com pioneered the notion of bringing remotely provisioned services into the enterprise.
* In 2002, Amazon.com launched the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, a suite of enterprise-oriented services that provide remotely provisioned storage, computing resources, and business functionality.
* A slightly different evocation of the term "Network Cloud" or "Cloud" was introduced in the early 1990s throughout the networking industry.
* It wasn't until 2006 that the term "cloud computing" emerged in the commercial arena.
# 2.2 Business Drivers
* The origins and inspirations of many of the characteristics, models, and mechanisms covered throughout subsequent chapters can be traced back to the upcoming business drivers.
## Capacity Planning
* Capacity planning is the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services.
* Within this context, capacity represents the maximum amount of work that an IT resource is capable of delivering in a given period of time.
* A discrepancy between the capacity of an IT resource and its demand can result in a system becoming either inefficient (over-provisioning) or unable to fulfill user needs (under-provisioning).
* Seeks to minimize this discrepancy
* Different capacity planning strategies exist:
  * Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
  * Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
  * Match Strategy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases
* Planning for capacity can be challenging because it requires estimating usage load fluctuations.
* There is a constant need to balance peak usage requirements without unnecessary over-expenditure on infrastructure.
## Cost Reduction
* A direct alignment between IT costs and business performance can be difficult to maintain.
* This can make the support of new and expanded business automations an ever-increasing investment. 
* Much of this required investment is funneled into infrastructure expansion because the usage potential of a given automation solution will always be limited by the processing power of its underlying infrastructure.
* Two costs need to be accounted for:
  * The cost of acquiring new infrastructure
  * The cost of its ongoing ownership.
* Operational overhead represents a considerable share of IT budgets, often exceeding up-front investment costs.
* Common forms of infrastructure-related operating overhead include the following:
  * Technical personnel required to keep the environment operational
  * Upgrades and patches that introduce additional testing and deployment cycles
  * Utility bills and capital expense investments for power and cooling
  * Security and access control measures that need to be maintained and enforced to protect infrastructure resources
  * Administrative and accounts staff that may be required to keep track of licenses and support arrangements
