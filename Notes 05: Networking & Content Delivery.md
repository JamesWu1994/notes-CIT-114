# 6.01 What is Cyber Security?

* Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

## What are the risks to having poor cybersecurity?
* There are many risks, some more serious than others. Among these dangers are malware erasing your entire system, an attacker breaking into your system and altering files, an attacker using your computer to attack others, or an attacker stealing your credit card information and making unauthorized purchases. There is no guarantee that even with the best precautions some of these things won't happen to you, but there are steps you can take to minimize the chances.

## What can you do to improve your cybersecurity?

* Recognize risks
* **Hacker, attacker, or intruder** – These terms are applied to the people who seek to exploit weaknesses in software and computer systems for their own gain. Although their intentions are sometimes benign and motivated by curiosity, their actions are typically in violation of the intended use of the systems they are exploiting. The results can range from mere mischief (creating a virus with no intentionally negative impact) to malicious activity (stealing or altering information).
* **Malicious code** – Malicious code (also called malware) is unwanted files or programs that can cause harm to a computer or compromise data stored on a computer. Various classifications of malicious code include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.
* Malicious code may have the following characteristics:
  * It might require you to actually do something before it infects your computer. This action could be opening an email attachment or going to a particular webpage.
  * Some forms of malware propagate without user intervention and typically start by exploiting a software vulnerability. Once the victim computer has been infected, the malware will attempt to find and infect other computers. This malware can also propagate via email, websites, or network-based software.
  * Some malware claims to be one thing, while in fact doing something different behind the scenes. For example, a program that claims it will speed up your computer may actually be sending confidential information to a remote intruder.
* **Vulnerabilities** – Vulnerabilities are flaws in software, firmware, or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions in a system. They can be caused by software programming errors. Attackers take advantage of these errors to infect computers with malware or perform other malicious activity.
* To minimize risks:
  * Keep software up to date.
  * Run up-to-date antivirus software.
  * Use strong passwords.
  * Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  * Install a firewall.
