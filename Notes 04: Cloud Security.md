# 4.01 Introduction
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) helps you move faster, reduce IT costs, and attain global scale through a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services.
* One of the main benefits of cloud services is the ability it gives you to optimize costs to match your needs, even as those needs change.
* AWS offers pay-as-you-go (on demand), reservation-based, and bulk-use (pay less when you use more) payment models; this enables us to obtain the best return on your investment for each specific use case.

# 4.02 How do you pay for AWS?
* AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for over 160 cloud services.

## Pay-as-you-go
* With AWS you only pay for what use, helping your organization remain agile, responsive and always able to meet scale demands.
* Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without over committing budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes.
* By paying for services on an as needed basis, you can redirect your focus to innovation and invention, reducing procurement complexity and enabling your business to be fully elastic.

## Save when you reserve
* For certain services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity.
* Reserved Instances are available in 3 options:
  * All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI)
  * Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI)
  * No Upfront Reserved Instance (NURI)
* To maximize your savings, you can pay all up-front and receive the largest discount.
* Partial up-front RI's offer lower discounts but give you the option to spend less up front.
* Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing up front and receive a smaller discount, but allowing you to free up capital to spend in other projects.
