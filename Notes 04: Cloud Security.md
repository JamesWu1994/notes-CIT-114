1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.

# 4.01 Introduction
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) helps you move faster, reduce IT costs, and attain global scale through a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services.
* One of the main benefits of cloud services is the ability it gives you to optimize costs to match your needs, even as those needs change.
* AWS offers pay-as-you-go (on demand), reservation-based, and bulk-use (pay less when you use more) payment models; this enables us to obtain the best return on your investment for each specific use case.

# 4.02 How do you pay for AWS?
* AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for over 160 cloud services.

## Pay-as-you-go
* With AWS you only pay for what use, helping your organization remain agile, responsive and always able to meet scale demands.
* Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without over committing budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes.
* By paying for services on an as needed basis, you can redirect your focus to innovation and invention, reducing procurement complexity and enabling your business to be fully elastic.

## Save when you reserve
* For certain services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity.
* Reserved Instances are available in 3 options:
  * All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI)
  * Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI)
  * No Upfront Reserved Instance (NURI)
* To maximize your savings, you can pay all up-front and receive the largest discount.
* Partial up-front RI's offer lower discounts but give you the option to spend less up front.
* Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing up front and receive a smaller discount, but allowing you to free up capital to spend in other projects.

3. Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
4. What new facts did you learn from this section?

## Pay less by using more
* With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases.
* For services such as S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB.

# 4.03 Key Principles of Pricin
## Understand the fundamentals of pricing
* There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:

 * Compute
 * Storage
 * Outbound data transfer

## Start early with cost optimization
* Adopting cloud services is not just a technical evolution. It also requires changes to how organizations operate. As you move from IT being treated as a capital investment that happens periodically to a world where pricing is closely tied to efficient use of resources, it pays to understand what drives cloud pricing so you can build a strategy for optimizing it.

## Maximize the power of flexibility
* One of the key advantages of cloud-based resources is that you don’t pay for them when they’re not running.

## Use the right pricing model for the job
* AWS offers several pricing models depending on product. These include:
 * On Demand means you pay for compute or database capacity with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.
 * Dedicated Instances (available with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Links to an external site.) (Amazon EC2)) run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer.
 * Spot Instances are an Amazon EC2 pricing mechanism that lets you purchase spare computing capacity with no upfront commitment at discounted hourly rates.
 * Reservations provide you with the ability to receive a greater discount, up to 75 percent, by paying for capacity ahead of time.
