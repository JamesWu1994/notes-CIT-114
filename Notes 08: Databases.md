# 8.01 What is an Operating System?
* An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer.
* It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.
* It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.
* Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

## Types of operating systems
* Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy.
* Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems.
* The three most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey).
* A GUI lets you use your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text.

## Microsoft Windows
* Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s.
* There have been many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are Windows 10 (released in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), and Windows Vista (2007).
* Windows comes pre-loaded on most new PCs, which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.

## Linux
Linux (pronounced LINN-ux) is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world.
This is different from proprietary software like Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it.
The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions—or versions—you can choose from.

# 8.02 Available Operating Systems at AWS
* Amazon has a variety of operating systems that can be used in EC2 based virtual machines and other compute resources.

* Supported EC2 Operating Systems
* Linux on AWS Marketplace
* Amazon Linux 2
* Windows on AWS

# 8.03 AWS Compute Services
* In Amazon Web Services, there are four broad categories of compute services. These are:
  * Virtual Machines
  * Containers
  * Serverless
  * Platform as a Service

## Categories of Virtual Machines
### Virtual Machines
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.  Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
* This allows you to build Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) applications for instance-based virtual machines. 
* You can provision virtual machines and manage them as you choose.
* This method of compute is a familiar concepts with IT professionals.

### Serverless
* AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume—there is no charge when your code is not running.

### Containers
* Amazon Web Services has many different container services including Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
* These services are instance-based and enable you to run multiple workloads on a single operating system (OS).
* Containers spin up more quickly than virtual machines, thus offering responsiveness.

### Platform as a Service
As a category, platform as a service allows a company to focus on building code and applications rather than manage infrastructure. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a platform as a service (PaaS).
