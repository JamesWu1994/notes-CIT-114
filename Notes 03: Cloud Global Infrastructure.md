1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.

# Chapter 1 The Big Picture
* Devops is a way of thinking and a way of working
* It is part of the cultural weave that shapes how we work and why
* An equally important part of our culture is our values, norms, and knowledge
* What makes tools “devops” is the manner of their use, not fundamental characteristics of the tools themselves.
* Devops is not just another software development methodology. Although it is related to and even influenced by software development methodologies like Agile or XP, and its practices can include software development methods, or features like infrastructure automation and continuous delivery, it is much more than just the sum of these parts. While these concepts are related and may be frequently seen in devops environments, focusing solely on them misses the bigger picture—the cultural and interpersonal aspects that give devops its power.

## A Snapshot of Devops Culture
* A new engineer at Etsy starts her first day with a laptop and a development virtual machine (VM) already set up with the appropriate accounts for access and authorization, the most common GitHub repositories cloned, aliases and shortcuts to relevant tools precreated, and a guide with new hire information and links to other company resources on her desktop.
* A current employee will pair with the new employee to walk through what testing and development processes she will use in her day-to-day work. She starts by writing code on her local development VM, which is set up with configuration management to be nearly identical to the live production environment.
* In Etsy’s high-trust, blameless environment, people are given the trust and authority to decide whether a code review is necessary.

## The Evolution of Culture
* This story of Etsy today is in stark contrast to how things were several years ago with a less transparent and more error-prone deployment process that took close to four hours.
* Developers had their own blade servers to work on, rather than virtual machines, but the blade servers weren’t powerful enough to run the automated test suites to completion.
* Tests that were run in the staging environment took a couple of hours to complete, and even then they were flaky enough to make their results less than useful.
* Developers had their own blade servers to work on, rather than virtual machines, but the blade servers weren’t powerful enough to run the automated test suites to completion.

## The Value of The Story
* Effective DevOps contains case studies and stories from both teams and individuals.

3. Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
A key takeaway from this event for me was the value of failure.
It is one thing to talk about how something should work in theory, but there is often a great deal of difference between how something should work in theory and how things turn out in practice.
