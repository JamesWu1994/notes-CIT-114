1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.

# Chapter 1 The Big Picture
* Devops is a way of thinking and a way of working
* It is part of the cultural weave that shapes how we work and why
* An equally important part of our culture is our values, norms, and knowledge
* What makes tools “devops” is the manner of their use, not fundamental characteristics of the tools themselves.
* Devops is not just another software development methodology. Although it is related to and even influenced by software development methodologies like Agile or XP, and its practices can include software development methods, or features like infrastructure automation and continuous delivery, it is much more than just the sum of these parts. While these concepts are related and may be frequently seen in devops environments, focusing solely on them misses the bigger picture—the cultural and interpersonal aspects that give devops its power.

## A Snapshot of Devops Culture
* A new engineer at Etsy starts her first day with a laptop and a development virtual machine (VM) already set up with the appropriate accounts for access and authorization, the most common GitHub repositories cloned, aliases and shortcuts to relevant tools precreated, and a guide with new hire information and links to other company resources on her desktop.
* A current employee will pair with the new employee to walk through what testing and development processes she will use in her day-to-day work. She starts by writing code on her local development VM, which is set up with configuration management to be nearly identical to the live production environment.
